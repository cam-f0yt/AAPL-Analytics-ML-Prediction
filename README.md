 Project Overview
This end-to-end financial analysis system combines data engineering, machine learning, and business intelligence to provide actionable stock market insights:
Data Pipeline → Automated extraction of AAPL financials from Yahoo Finance into SQL Server
Machine Learning → Random Forest model predicting next-day price movements
Visualization → Interactive Power BI dashboard with predictions and financial KPIs

 Technical Architecture

                          Feature Engineering → Random Forest → Predictions

Technology Stack

Data Collection: yfinance, pandas, SQLAlchemy
Database: SQL Server with ODBC integration
Machine Learning: scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier)
Visualization: Power BI, matplotlib
Deployment: Serialized model (pickle) for production


 Model Architecture:
Feature Engineering
Created 10 engineered features across 5 time horizons (2, 5, 10, 20, 50 days):
Close Ratio Features (5 features):
Close_Ratio_N = Current_Close / N_Day_Moving_Average
Captures price momentum relative to historical averages
Trend Features (5 features):
Trend_N = Sum_of_Up_Days_in_N_Day_Window

Identifies directional momentum over rolling windows
Model Configuration:
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=200,       # Ensemble of 200 decision trees
    min_samples_split=200,  # Regularization to prevent overfitting
    random_state=1          # Reproducibility
)

Validation Strategy

Walk-forward backtesting with 250-day increments
No lookahead bias - features only use past data
Growing training window starting at 2,500 days
Tested on 2,708 out-of-sample days


 Power BI Dashboard (time period selected: over last 4 years)
Financial KPIs Tracked:
Net Income: $402.54B
Free Cash Flow: $418.60B
Current Stock Price: $275.25
30-Day Average Cost: $270.18

Visualizations:
Total Assets vs Total Liabilities (composition analysis)
Profit Margin trends over time
Cash Flow breakdown (Operating, Investing, Financing)
Share volume and price correlation
Volatility analysis with 300-day moving average
ML Prediction: UP/DOWN with confidence percentage


 Data Engineering
SQL Server Schema
Four normalized tables:

StockHistory - OHLCV data with dividends/splits
IncomeStatement - Revenue, expenses, net income
BalanceSheet - Assets, liabilities, equity
CashFlow - Operating, investing, financing activities

ETL Process:
# Automated pipeline unpivots financial statements
def unpivot_financials(df):
    df = df.melt(id_vars="MetricName", var_name="Date", value_name="Value")
    return df

# Loads into SQL Server with proper data types
income_statement_fixed.to_sql("IncomeStatement", engine, if_exists="replace")

 Key Insights
What Worked
 Multiple time horizons captured different market patterns
 Walk-forward validation prevented overfitting
 Regularization (min_samples_split=200) improved generalization
 Price ratios more predictive than absolute prices

Challenges Overcome
 Initial trend features too simplistic (binary sums)
 Long horizons (250, 1000 days) caused excessive data loss
 Custom probability thresholds reduced accuracy
→ Solution: Optimized horizons, standard predict(), increased regularization

 Future Enhancements
Model Improvements:
Add volume-based momentum indicators
Implement sentiment analysis from financial news
Multi-stock portfolio predictions

Infrastructure:
Real-time streaming data pipeline
Automated model retraining scheduler
API endpoint for predictions
Risk management metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)
